memcached module for PHP
========================

This module requires zlib library, used for on-the-fly data (de)compression.
Also, you'll need memcached to use it =)

This version adds the tags_delete function that was added in memcached-tags (branch of memcached-tag)

The memcached website is here: <http://www.danga.com/memcached/>

You will probably need libevent to install memcached. You can download it here: <http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/>
